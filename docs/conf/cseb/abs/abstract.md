**Title.** Inferring incidence rate ratios (IRR) from cross-sectional odds ratios (OR) using individual-based modelling, applied to major depression & harmful drinking

**Background.** Cross-sectional studies have estimated prevalence OR of 1.0--4.2 for harmful drinking and depression. If being depressed causally increases drinking (not the reverse), these associations may mechanistically derive from current depression increasing the rate of drinking onset, decreasing the rate of drinking recovery, or both. Understanding how ORs arise from IRRs can help interpret/compare OR and IRR estimates across cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.

**Objective.** Characterize the relationship between cross-sectional ORs and IRRs for drinking onset and recovery while depressed.

**Methods.** We developed a stochastic individual-based model of an open population of 10,000 individuals aged 10--59. Informed by literature review, each modelled individual can experience depression [drinking] onset//recovery at base rates of 4//100 [2//33] per-100 person-years, resulting in equilibrium prevalence of 3.8 [5.4]%. We then varied IRRs of drinking onset (IRRo: 1--8) and recovery (IRRx: 0.125--1) while depressed and examined OR-IRR relationships. In sensitivity analysis, we further varied base rates by factors of {0.5,1.0,1.5}. For each parameter set, we estimated age-adjusted ORs for drinking and depression via logistic regression from the entire population at equilibrium, and report mean ORs across 41 stochastic repetitions.

**Results.** ORs underestimated onset IRRs by around 4: OR ≈ 1+1/4(IRRo−1), and were hardly influenced by recovery IRRs. OR bias towards 1 worsened with faster depression recovery rates (b) and slower drinking recovery rates (d), approximately per: OR ≈ (b+d·IRRo)/(b+d·IRRx). Depression and drinking onset rates had little influence on the OR-IRR relationship.

**Conclusion.** In this context (low-prevalence and reversible onset and exposure), ORs significantly underestimate onset effect size and provide little information on possible recovery effects. Future work will examine age effects and weighted sampling.
